    "In our final discussion around how real gases differ from an ideal gas, we are going to return to the Joule expansions which was introduced in Lecture 5. In this expansion, a gas which is initially on the left side of a container is suddenly allowed to expand into the right. If the system is entirely isolated, then no work is done on the gas, and it cannot exchange heat with its surroundings. As such, the internal energy of the gas remains constant.\n",
