    "Ok, now let's consider the above example again. However, we're going to change one of the systems such that it acts as a reservoir (or heat bath). We then place the other system into thermal contact with the reservoir. The reservoir has such an enormour amount of energy compared to the system that any change in its temperature as it heats the smaller system is completely negligible. This is the canonical ensemble discussed previously.\n",
