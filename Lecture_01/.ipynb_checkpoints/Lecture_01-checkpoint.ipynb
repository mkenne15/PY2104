    "We want to study the physics of a macroscopic object which is comprised of many particles. Say, for example, that we had one mole of a substance. This would mean we have $N\\sim6\\times10^{23}$ particles (where this is Avagardro's number) to study. Clearly this is not feasible, as to have a proper description we would need the momenta and positions for each particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of doing this, we are instead going to study macroscopic laws and properties which are ultimately governed by microscopic properties, but which emerge from averaging over these microscopic properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, there are two approaches to studying macroscopic physics. The first is the study of classical thermodynamics (Carnot, Clausius, Kelvin, Joule). This approach requires experiments on macroscopic systems, and avoidS any description of atomic physics. The laws are thus phenomenological. The second approach is that of statistical physics, which starts out from an atomic description of matter and tries to derive the laws of macroscopic bodies from these atomic properties (Maxwell, Boltzmann, Gibbs)."

Thus, the pressure is not really time independant - at any given time, there may be more or less particles hitting the wall then at other times due to the random movements of the particles in the gas - this is Brownian motion. As such, the piston is not perfectly in place - it is constantly shifting around by small amounts as the number of particles hitting it varies. \n",

However, when dealing with a large number of particles, or with macroscopic objects then the variation in the number of particles hitting the piston is so small, we cannot observe the changes, meaning the pressure appears to be constant to us. This is what we'll refer to as the thermodynamic limit.\n",

    "- **Intensive variables** (such as temperature, pressure), which do not scale.\n",

    "## Working with large numbers\n",
    "Fortunately, there are some tips and tricks we can use when dealing with large numbers, which will help throughout our studies. As an example, imagine I have 10 containers, each of which can only hold 1 marble, and I have some marbles. How many distinct ways can we arrange our 10 cups (empty, not empty) if (i) I have 10 marbles or (ii) only 4 marbles? First, let's consider a general example where I have $n$ cups and $r$ marbles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first marble can go in any of the $n$ cups, the second can go in any of $n-1$, etc, until the $r^{th}$ marble can go into any of the remaining $n-r+1$ cups. Thus, the number of possible arrangements is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\Omega = n\\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times ... \\times (n-r+1)\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Now, in the above, I said first marble, and second marble, as if each marble is special or identifiable. In general, I don't actually care which marble goes in which cup - to account for this, we take the above expression and divide by $r!$ to get\n",

    "This expression can be used to work out the questions discusse above. However, this expression can get unwieldy. To see how, let's turn the above problem into a physics problem - simple replace cups with atoms, and marbles with units (or quanta) of energy. So imagine I have $n=6 \\times 10^{23}$ atoms. At this stage, it's a bit easier to look at the natural log of $\\Omega$, which is \n",
